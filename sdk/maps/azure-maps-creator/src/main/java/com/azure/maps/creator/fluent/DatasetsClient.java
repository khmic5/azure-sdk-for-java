     * <p>### Submit Get Details Request
     *
     * <p>To get the details for a previously created dataset, you will issue a `GET` request with the `datasetId` in
     * the path.
     *
     * <p>### Get Details Response
     *
     * <p>The Get Details API returns the details for a dataset in `json` format. The response contains the following
     * fields (if they are not null or empty): &gt; created - The timestamp the dataset was created. &gt; datasetId -
     * The id for the dataset. &gt; description - The description for the dataset. &gt; datasetSources - The source data
     * that was used when the create request was issued. &gt; ontology - The source
     * [ontology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/creator-facility-ontology) that was used in the
     * conversion service for the input data.&lt;br/&gt;
     *
     * <p>The `datasetSources` describes the source data that was used when the create request was issued and contains
     * the following elements (if they are not null or empty): &gt; conversionIds - The list of `conversionId` (null if
     * none were provided). &gt; appendDatasetId - The `datasetId` that was used for an append operation (null if none
     * was used). &gt;featureCounts - The counts for each feature type in the dataset.&lt;br/&gt;
     *
     * <p>Here's a sample response returning the `timestamp`, `datasetId`, `description`, `datasetSources`, and
     * `ontology` of a dataset resource:
     *
     * <p>```json { "timestamp": "2020-01-01T22:50:48.123Z", "datasetId": "f6495f62-94f8-0ec2-c252-45626f82fcb2",
     * "description": "Some description or comment for the dataset.", "datasetSources": { "conversionIds": [
     * "15d21452-c9bb-27b6-5e79-743ca5c3205d" ], }, "ontology": "facility-2.0", "featureCounts": { "directoryInfo": 2,
     * "category": 10, "facility": 1, "level": 3, "unit": 183, "zone": 3, "verticalPenetration": 6, "opening": 48,
     * "areaElement": 108 } } ```.
     *
     * @param datasetId The identifier for the dataset to query from.
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws com.azure.core.management.exception.ManagementException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
     * @return detail information for the dataset.
